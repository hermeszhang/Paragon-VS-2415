Paragon-VS-2415 debug connector notes
based on:
http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/XDS_Target_Connection_Guide#Single_Device_Non-buffered_Configuration

distance between debug header and mcu should be less than 6 inches as per first paragraph of Single Device Non-buffered Configuration.
see figure 1. of wiki document

debug-20-pin	mcu-pins	signal
1		60		TMS		

2		9		NTRST		
4.7k pulldown resistor to -40. 
some docs say 2.2k, some say 10k, wiki doc says 4.7k 

3		59		TDI

4		NC		TDIS
connected to VSS	
used by debugger to tell if debugger is connected to board

5		NC		VTRef
connected to VDD through 100 ohm current limiting resistor

6		NC		Key
connected to VSS

7		58		GPIO37/TDO
TDO needs 22-42 ohm termination resistor in series 
(as close to mcu as possible) see note under "For JTAG signals that are not clocks". 
TDO also connects to J10 so that configuration jumpers can bring this to gnd. pulled up by default on mcu reset.		

8		NC		GND
connected to VSS

9		NC		NC		
some drawings show pin 9 and 11 are connected but xds110 doesn't use RTCK and pin 9 is NC
	
10		NC		GND
connected to VSS

11		57		TCK
TCK needs 22-42 ohm termination resistor in series

12		NC		GND
connected to VSS

13		76		GPIOOUT0
mcu pin 76 is unused GPIO13 - used for possible debugging

14		77		GPIOOUT1
mcu pin 77 is unused GPIO14 - used for possible debugging

15		8		nReset /XRS
reset pin needs 4.7k pullup to VDD - pulled low to reset, also connected to J10 pin 2

16		NC		GND
connected to VSS

17		46		GPIOIN0
mcu pin 46 is unused GPIO25 - used for possible debugging

18		47		GPIOIN1
mcu pin 47 is unused GPIO16 - used for possible debugging

19		NC		NC

20		nc		GND
connected to VSS


J10 connections
1. VSS	- moved from pin 2 to pin 1 so three pin inline connector can be used for serial programing
2. /RST - moved from pin 1 to pin 2 so two pin inline connector can be used for remote reset
3. SCIRXDA
4. VSS
5. SCITXDA
6. VSS
7. TDO - jumper from pin 7 to pin 8 to bring TDO low for boot configuration
8. VSS
9. CTRIPFCOUT
10. VSS - jumper from pin 9 to pin 10 to bring TDO low for boot configuration

for serial programming - three pin inline connector to plug into j10
j10 1 - VSS - gnd
j10 3 - SCIRXDA
j10 5 - SCIRXDA

for remote reset two pin inline connector to plug into j10
j10 2 - /rst
j10 4 - vss - gnd

for boot config jumpers be able to add jumpers between j10 7 and 8 as well as j10 9 and 10
